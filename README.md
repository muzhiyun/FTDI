# FTDI
As you can see, there are many similarly named Python libraries claiming to be used for FTDI, some of which have been around for a long time, while others are still being updated. We have reinvented the wheel too many times.

However, currently, I have found that they still have some imperfections. It seems that others are unwilling to make changes due to the confusing naming style, but to be honest, I don't mind the naming style. As long as it works. What I really need to consider is whether there is still a need to reinvent the wheel.


All compatibility issues can be resolved by adding a layer of wrapper, and all performance issues can be resolved by removing a layer of wrapper.
